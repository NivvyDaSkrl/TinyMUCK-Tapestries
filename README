This is the TinyMUCK server that Tapestries MUCK uses. It is based on the TinyMUCK FB server.

Copyrights and Licenses vary from public domain to GPL. Please see individual files for more information. For my (WhiteFire's) contributions: Public domain.

This version of the server is expected to be end of lifed for a new one in not quite near future. It is posted here to build in Lua to the Muck and a new security system for a transition period before the new server is complete.

If you are trying to build this on anything other than a fairly modern Linux box, may god have mercy on your soul.

There is no github Wiki because Tapestries has it's own wiki, see https://www.fur.com/tapestries .

./configure is BROKEN. It will ruin your Makefile at the very least. It's not been updated in years. Feel free to fix this. :3
