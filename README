This is the TinyMUCK server that Tapestries MUCK uses. It is based on the TinyMUCK FB server.

Copyrights and Licenses vary from public domain to GPL. Please see individual files for more information.

This version of the server is expected to be end of lifed for a new one in not quite near future. It is posted here to build in Lua to the Muck and a new security system for a transition period before the new server is complete.

If you are trying to build this on anything other than a fairly modern Linux box, may god have mercy on your soul.
